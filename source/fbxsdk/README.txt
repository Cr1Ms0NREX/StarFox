Autodesk FDB SDK
Version: 2015.1
Download from: http://www.autodesk.com/products/fbx/overview

fbxsdk.props looks for the SDK in the default install folder "C:\Program Files\Autodesk\FBX\FBX SDK\2015.1", but you can override this by setting an environment variable named FBX_SDK_ROOT to your installed path. You can also try using this if you installed a newer version, although the code may not compile against a newer version.
